# pyubx2 Release Notes

### RELEASE 1.1.4

ENHANCEMENTS:

1. Add functionality to decode RXM-SFRBX navigation data dwrds on a single-pass basis. NB: `pyubx2` will continue to output parsed UBX data as individual `UBXMessage` objects. There are no plans to aggregate time series data across multiple RXM-SFRBX messages or to perform conversion to other output formats e.g. RINEX.
2. Add Python 3.10 to list of supported Python 3 editions (no code changes were required).

### RELEASE 1.1.3

ENHANCEMENTS:

1. Extend POLL message types to include NAV - thanks for Nerolf05 for contribution.
2. Add bitfield definitions for TIM (timing) GET messages.

FIXES:

1. Fix payload for LOG-FINDTIME SET message (incorrect u-blox documentation) - thanks to qcabrol for contribution.

### RELEASE 1.1.2

ENHANCEMENTS:

1. Add bitfield definitions for ESF External Sensor Fusion, HNR High Rate Navigation and LOG messages.

FIXES:

1. Fix ESF-MEAS parsing with calibTtagValid flag setting (if calibTtagValid = 1, the final dataField contains the calibTtag).
2. Fix NAV-SAT 'flags' bitfield parsing.

### RELEASE 1.1.1

ENHANCEMENTS:

1. Added new optional boolean keyword argument `parsebitfield` to `UBXReader` and `UBXMessage` constructors and `UBXReader.parse()` static method. If True (the default), `pyubx2` parses bitfields (type 'X' attributes) as individual bit flags. If False, bitfields are left as byte sequences (i.e. same behaviour as `pyubx2` <=1.0.16)

### RELEASE 1.1.0

ENHANCEMENTS:

1. New functionality added in `ubxmessage.py` to parse individual bit flags in bitfield ('X' type) attributes, where defined. For example, the NAV-PVT attribute `valid` (X1) is now parsed as four individual bit flags: `validDate` (U1), `validTime` (U1), `fullyResolved` (U1) and `validMag` (U1).

2. CFG, NAV & MON payload definitions updated in `ubxtypes_get.py` and `ubxtypes_set.py` to model bitfield ('X' type) attributes as groups of individual bit flags. Payload definitions for other message categories (MGA, RXM, etc.) will be updated in a subsequent release (contributions welcome).

3. UBX messages can also be created using individual bit flag keywords.

4. **NB:** If you're using the associated graphical client PyGPSClient, this will need to be upgraded to v1.1.0 to accommodate the pyubx2 changes.

### RELEASE 1.0.16

ENHANCEMENTS:

1. Message filter option added to ubxdump command line utility. See README for usage.

2. New payload attribute type "A" added for byte arrays (e.g. MON-SPAN spectrum attribute).

3. For ease of processing and charting, MON-SPAN spectrum attribute now parsed as a single array of integers per Rf block e.g. `spectrum_01[]` rather than as 256 separate integers per Rf block e.g. `spectrum_01_01`, `spectrum_01_02`, etc. 

### RELEASE 1.0.15

ENHANCEMENTS:

1. The ubxdump.py example has been moved into the pyubx2cli module and configured as a setup entry point. It is now available as a simple command line utility. See README for usage.

### RELEASE 1.0.14

ENHANCEMENTS:

1. Additional configuration parameters added for NEO-D9S, ZED-F9K, ZED-F9P & ZED-F9R Receivers:
   CFG_NAVHPG, CFG_PMP, CFG_RTCM, CFG_SFCORE, CFG_SFIMU, CFG_SFODO

### RELEASE 1.0.13

FIXES:

1. CFG-DAT SET payload definition corrected.

### RELEASE 1.0.12

FIXES:

1. Fix CFG-NAVX5 payload definition - thanks to Nerolf05 for contribution.

### RELEASE 1.0.11

FIXES:

1. Fix NAV-RELPOSNED payload definition - thanks to nikitamankovskii for contribution.

### RELEASE 1.0.10

FIXES:

1. Fix typo error in NAV-SBAS payload - thanks to Nerofl05 for contribution.

ENHANCEMENTS:

1. Add msgmode getter method to `ubxmessage.py` -  - thanks to Nerofl05 for contribution.

### RELEASE 1.0.9

ENHANCEMENTS:

1. Add CFG_BDS_USE_PRN_1_TO_5 to list of configuration keyIDs in ubxtypes_configdb.py - thanks to Nerolf05 for contribution.

FIXES:

1. Fix incorrect CFG-TMODE configuration keyIDs in ubxtypes_configdb.py.

### RELEASE 1.0.8

ENHANCEMENTS:

1. Add following GET/SET message types: CFG-ESFALG, CFG-ESFA, CFG-ESFG, CFG-ESFWT, CFG-HNR, CFG-SENIF, CFG-SLAS

FIXES:

1. Fix incorrect HNR-PVT payload definition

### RELEASE 1.0.7

ENHANCEMENTS:

1. Addition CFG-SIGNAL L2 keys added to `ubxtypes_configdb.py` - thanks to horace1024 for contribution.

### RELEASE 1.0.6

ENHANCEMENTS:

1. UBXReader updated to accept **kwargs: 'ubxonly' and 'msgmode'. Will continue to accept *args for backwards compatibility, but these are now deprecated and may be removed in future versions.
2. Minor enhancements to nominal value assignments - floats will now get nominal value of 0.0.

### RELEASE 1.0.5

ENHANCEMENTS:

1. Added additional helper method `get_bits()` to find value of specified (masked) bit(s) in a UBX bitfield ('X') attribute. See docstring for usage.
2. Docstrings updated.

### RELEASE 1.0.4

Some refactoring of static and helper methods. Improved Sphinx-compliant docstrings.

ENHANCEMENTS:

1. Static parse() method moved from UBXMessage to UBXReader. **NB:** If you were invoking parse() indirectly via the `UBXReader.read()` method, the change is transparent. If you were invoking `UBXMessage.parse()` directly, this will need to be changed to `UBXReader.parse()`. **NB:** If you're using PyGPSClient, this will need to be updated to v0.2.27-beta.
2. Static `calc_checksum()` and `isvalid_checksum()` methods moved from UBXMessage to ubxhelpers.py as stand-alone methods. 
3. Minor enhancements to mixed data stream validation and exception reporting.
4. Docstrings updated for better sphinx-apidoc compliance.

### RELEASE 1.0.3

FIXES:

1. Fixed bug in UBXReader.read() which cause looping with certain mixed protocol streams.

### RELEASE 1.0.2

Code streamlining.

1. De-duplicate CFG-MSG definitions in ubxtypes_core.py. Definitions UBX_CONFIG_CATEGORIES & UBX_CONFIG_MESSAGES
are now incorporated into UBX_CLASSES & UBX_MSGIDS. NB: PyGPSClient GUI will require update to v0.2.23.

### RELEASE 1.0.1

1. Update development status to Production/Stable.

### RELEASE 1.0.0

Marked to major version 1.0.0.
